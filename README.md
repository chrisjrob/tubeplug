Description
-----------
OpenSCAD design for replacement rubber feet / plugs.
This is an OpenSCAD design for the replacement for the rubber feet or plugs that fit into cut tube or piping.
Fully parametric.
These are used as chair feet, or for anything that has cut metal tubing, which needs a cover.
This is for the transom ladder on my boat.

Instructions
------------
Edit .scad file to specify the diameter of tubing, currently set to 25mm. Export STL, or use attached STL. Generate gcodes from STL and print.
It would probably benefit from being printed in soft PLA. For outdoor use, ABS might be sensible.
